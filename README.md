# Semantic Segmentation
Evaluate a few pre-trained models performing semantic segmentation on different images

We do a qualitative analysis of several pre-trained models (on [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) dataset) with different backbones, performing *Semantic Segmentation* on different input images.

[This notebook](https://github.com/BenoyRNair/SemanticSegmentation) was developed and tested in ***Google Colab***.
